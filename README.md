# Matthew Huh's Data Science Portfolio

## Intro

Hello and welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, you will find a myriad of projects that will help demonstrate my capabilities in regards to data science including data exploration, visualization, and modeling. This portfolio is a work in progress, and I can assure you that there will be more to come!

## [Energy Production in the United States](https://github.com/mhuh22/Thinkful/blob/master/Portfolio/Prep%20Capstone/The%20State%20of%20Energy%20(in%20the%20United%20States).ipynb)
Date: April 2018

Overview: Energy usage has been an interesting topic in the last century with the rise of automobiles, pollution, and environmental regulations. What this project looks at is a broad overview on what energy consumption and production has looked like from 1946 to 2016, and extrapolate potential trends from existing data.

Skills: Data Exploration & Visualization, linear regression

Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy)

## [Predicting the Outcome of Kickstarter Projects](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mhuh22/Thinkful/blob/master/Portfolio/Supervised%20Learning%20Capstone/Predicting%20The%20Outcome%20of%20Kickstarter%20Projects.ipynb)
Date: July 2018

Overview: Kickstarter allows creators to transform ideas into actual products, but a lot of projects fail to meet expectations or get off the ground. What factors are responsible for dictating the success or failure of project, and what should creators do to bolster their odds?

Skills: Data exploration & visualization, feature engineering & selection,
machine Learning (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting)
        
Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy, scikit-learn)

## [Clustering with News Publications](https://github.com/mhuh22/Thinkful/blob/master/Bootcamp/Unit%204/Lesson%205%20-%20Unsupervised%20Learning%20Capstone/Unsupervised%20Learning%20Capstone.ipynb)
Date: August 2018

Overview: For the most part, people are free to choose what news outlets they read and follow. In the United States, there is a near-endless list of sites that people can choose from in order to get their daily news and over time, they develop preferences for sites that they are more attached to, and do their best to avoid. What I would like to examine in this project is if it is possible to differentiate from several different publications based on their works.

Skills: Natural language processing, clustering (k-means, spectral, & affinity propagation), meachine learning (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting)

Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, scikit-learn, nltk, re, spacy)
